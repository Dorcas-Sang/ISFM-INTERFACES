Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) 

ISFM is a set of agricultural practices considered as a single unit consisting of the integrated application of mineral and organic fertilizers, use of improved resilient crop varieties and improved agricultural practices, and adapted to local conditions (Vanlauwe et al.,2010; 2015). This agricultural practice is being considered by the COINS project (Co-developing innovations for sustainable land management in West African smallholder farming systems) which is one of the 5 regional projects supported by the [INTERFACES](https://sustainable-landmanagement-africa.net/project/interfaces-fr/) project (Supporting Pathways to Sustainable Land Management in Africa). The [COINS]( https://sustainable-landmanagement-africa.net/project/coins-fr/) project goal is to scale ISFM up in 3 disctricts (Savelugu, Tolon, and Mion) in Northern Ghana.

The Horticultural Science group at the University of Bonn will contribute to the INTERFACES project by creating an impact pathway and forecast the impact of ISFM in Northern Ghana. This will be done using the group's Decision analysis approach which will be based on holistic systems understanding to support decision-making on sustainable land management in Northern Ghana.

In this repository a holistic model will be developed, translating a conceptual model to a mathematical model. The model incorporates the benefits, the costs, and the risks related to ISFM on a maize-soybean rotation system. The benefits are associated with the 5 indicators of the Sustainable Intensification Assessment Framework (SIAF) which are productivity, economic, human, environmental, and social domains (Musumba et al., 2017). The productivity domain will look at the yield of the associated crops, the economic will focus on the monetary return of crops, the human domain will assess the impact on nutrition and food security, the social domain will focus on gender and cultural norms, while the environmental domain will assess the impact on soil fertility (Kihara et al., 2022).

**The first draft of the model depicts an ex-ante economic evaluation and expected utility theory of ISFM**
