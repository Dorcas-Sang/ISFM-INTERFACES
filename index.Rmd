Using probabilistic modelling approches, we are modelling the farm level benefits of Integrated Soil Fertility Managament (ISFM), a sustainable intensification practice. ISFM holds promise to improve soil fertility and increase productivity on the already exciting land for small-holder farmers in Northern Ghana. ISFM is a set of the following:

**Improved seed**
As an entry point to ISFM, using imporved and resilient seed has its own benefits and costs incurred as they are more expensive than the farmers seed. However farmers are aware that these improved seed yield more than their own seed. 

**Inorganic fertilizer**
Because the soils are poor, they need to be replenished with additional nutrients. Using inorganic fertlizer such as NPK and urea on improved seed is the second layer in ISFM. This second layer of ISFM involves additional costs of buying the fertilizer and additional labor for fertilizer application.

**Organic fertilizer**
This includes using improved seed and the use of purchased or already available organic material such as crop residue and animal manure.

**Fertilizer combination **
Because each type of fertilizer has its unique characteristic and benefit, combining the two will have synerstic benefits that will be more beneficial than applying one alone on improved seed.


**Minimum tillage**
To avoid the compaction of soil with heavy machinery, tillage is recommanded. However in the context of Northern Ghana where zero tillage is almost impossible due to long drought and the nature of their soils, minimum tillage is recommended. Here farmers are adviused to avoid using tractors on their soils to tilt the land. This is the last layer on ISFM, which will be done on improved seed and fertilizer combination.

ISFM in this study has 6 components giving the following decision options:

1. Use of Improved seed (As the entry point to ISFM)
2. Improved seed and inorganic fertilizer 
3. Improved seed and organic fertilizer 
4. Improved seed and fertilizer combination (half organic and inorganic fertilizer)
5. Improved seed and minimum tillage
6. Improved seed, fertilizer combination and minimum tillage (Complete ISFM)

These 6 options will be modeled in a maize and soybean rotation system against the statusquo of maize monoculture.

The model will answer the following question: 
**Should Agricultural and Development (AR4D) actors promote ISFM in Northern Ghana? **

We identified important ressources that impact ISFM outcome. We account for them as typology to identify the impact and tradeoffs of ISFM

```{r typology_graph, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Create a data frame for the ressources and their strengths in being important factors for intersectionality

factors <- data.frame(
  Ressources = c("Land", "Agricultural inputs", "Labor",  
                 "Technical skills/knowledge", "Market Linkages", 
                 "Extension services", "Financial ressources", 
            "Utilities (electricity, internet)", "Time"),
  Strength = c(5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 4, 0, 3)
)

ggplot(factors, aes(x=Strength, y=reorder(Ressources, Strength))) +
  geom_point(size=4, color="darkgreen") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title="Intersectionality typology",
       x="Strength", y="Ressources") +
  geom_segment(aes(xend=0, yend=Ressources), color="lightgray")


```


The conceptual model of impact pathways of ISFM is described in the below figure.
This model incorporate the costs, the benefits and the risks of ISFM based on the high value ressources identified.

# ISFM benefits and tradeoffs in Northern Ghana 

Here is our simulation for the 6 ISFM components 

```{r ISFM_mcsimulation, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Setting seed to ensure consistent results
#each time we run the entire simulation

```


Here we present the ISFM income for farmers based on different resources representing farmers typology. This encompases how much a farmer gets from the yield only (economic benefits) against the statusquo. We represent this in as cumulative cashflows for the simulation period.

We need to transform the montecarlo simulation data with z-score transformation to enable comparison at different scale. 

```{r}
z_score <- function(x) {
  (x - mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) / sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}

ISFM_pivoted_outcome_data$Normalized_Change <- z_score(ISFM_pivoted_outcome_data$`Absolute difference`)

```

Presenting the tradeoffs between the different outcomes for each farmer typology based on the sustainable intensfication assesment framework indicators (productivity, economic, environmental, social and human). These are represented in terms of relative change compared to the statusquo. 

```{r}

z_score <- function(x) {
  (x - mean(x, na.rm = TRUE)) / sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
}

ISFM_pivoted_outcome_data <- ISFM_pivoted_outcome_data %>%

# Input data for the simulations 

## Summary

Here we provide a summary of the garden intervention options. We do this with a summary table of the simulation results. We show the percentage of missing values as well as the mean, median and standard deviation (SD) for each output of our model simulations. We use the `gt_plt_summary()` from {gtExtras} and with options from {svglite}. The table shows the  name, the plot overview as well as the number of missing values, the mean, median and the standard deviation of the distribution for all variables that were fed into the model from our input table of uncertainty values. 

```{r gtExtras_summary_x, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Subset the outputs from the mcSimulation function (y) to summarize only on the variables that we want.
# names(garden_simulation_results$x)
mcSimulation_table_x <- data.frame(garden_simulation_results$x[2:72]) #,
 # names(garden_simulation_results$y)

gtExtras::gt_plt_summary(mcSimulation_table_x) 
# a summary table with missing, mean, median and sd

```

<!-- The table shows the variable name, the plot overview as well as the number of missing values, the mean, median and the standard deviation of the distribution for all variables that were calculated in the model.  -->
