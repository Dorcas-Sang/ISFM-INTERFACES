Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) 

ISFM is a set of agricultural practices considered as a single unit consisting of the integrated application of mineral and organic fertilizers, use of improved resilient crop varieties and improved agricultural practices, and adapted to local conditions (Vanlauwe et al.,2010; 2015). This agricultural practice is being considered by the COINS project (Co-developing innovations for sustainable land management in West African small holder farming systems) which is one of the 5 regional projects supported by the INTERFACES project (Supporting Pathways to Sustainable Land Management in Africa). COINS project goal is to scale ISFM up in 3 regions (Savelugu, Tolon and Mion) in Northern Ghana.

The Horticultural Science group of Prof. Dr. Luedeling will contribute to the INTERFACES project by creating an impact pathway and forecast the impact of ISFM in Northern Ghana. This will be done using the group's Decision analysis approach which will be based on holistic systems understanding to support decision making on sustanaible land management in Northern Ghana.

In this repository a holistic model will be developped, translating a conceptual model to a mathematical model.
